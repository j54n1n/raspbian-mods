## Setup Raspberry Pi Desktop with VirtualBox
**You do not own an Raspberry Pi but wish to try out an Raspbian like operating system?**
Simply [grab the latest release](https://github.com/j54n1n/raspbian-mods/releases)
and download the VirtualBox Appliance file and
[import it to VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html#ovf).

**You do not know what is VirtualBox?**
Do not worry VirtualBox allows you to create a second virtual PC within your current
operating system. Simply grab the
[latest release for your system](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and download both
the *platform package* and *extension pack*. Install first the platform package and then apply
the extension pack by double clicking it. Now you are ready to create and import virtual
machines.
